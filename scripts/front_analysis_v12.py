"""ICON-2I objective synoptic-front analysis, auditable topology engine (v19).

The detector is intentionally conservative.  It identifies the warm-air
edge of baroclinic zones in wet-bulb potential temperature at 850 hPa, then
requires independent dry-temperature, density and flow evidence.  Optional
925 hPa fields test low-level vertical coherence and optional 700 hPa omega
describes frontal ascent; neither can erase a well-supported front merely
because a pressure surface intersects complex terrain.

Published confidence is an internal evidence score, not a calibrated
probability and not a substitute for a forecaster's surface analysis.

        front's bumps on the right, so if the warm air is on the wrong side
        the front is drawn as if it advanced backwards.

        ``_orient_warm_left`` establishes the convention on the *candidate*,

        published lines came out with the warm air on the right -- both
        boundaries whose two sides differ by only a few tenths of a kelvin,
