"""Synoptic frontal engine: declared scale, evidence fusion, variational geometry.

Three layers, in order.

**Scale.**  A front is a synoptic object.  Diagnosing it on a mesoscale field
produces a line that follows mesoscale wobbles, which is the measured cause of
the serpentine geometry this module replaces.  The analysis scale here is a
Gaussian low-pass at ``SYNOPTIC_SIGMA_KM``, derived in ``_SIGMA_DERIVATION``
from the filters used by peer-reviewed frontal climatologies rather than
chosen by eye.

**Evidence.**  A single continuous field combines quasi-independent physical
witnesses in log-odds.  Frontogenesis, vertical coherence and the absence of
terrain locking enter as *necessary* conditions -- near zero they contribute
large negative log-odds -- so that a long, persistent, terrain-anchored
thermal boundary cannot accumulate enough positive evidence to be published.
Length and persistence deliberately carry **no** positive weight here: they
are the defining properties of an orographic artefact, not of a front.

**Geometry.**  The axis is the ridge of that field, extracted with the
sub-pixel Hessian method of Steger (1998, IEEE TPAMI 20(2):113-125), linked
along its own orientation with a hard turn cap, and finished by alternating
elastic smoothing with a re-projection onto the local evidence maximum.  No
zero contour of a third derivative, and no 8-connected path: both quantise
direction and were the second measured cause of the old geometry.

The score is an evidence score in probabilistic form.  It is **not** a
calibrated probability: no labelled frontal archive exists in this repository
against which it could be calibrated.

    a candidate at all.  Growth is bidirectional from the strongest unused
    point, as in Steger's linking stage.

    The cap is expressed **per kilometre**, not per step.  A cap per step is
    meaningless because the step is one grid cell: at 9 km a cap of 40 degrees
    per step licenses 89 degrees per 20 km, and measured on an oblique

    Curvature is enforced on the **ridge tangent**, not on the raw step.  The
    tangent is an eigenvector of the Hessian of a field already smoothed at
    the synoptic scale, so it cannot turn quickly; the step between two
    sub-pixel points one grid cell apart can, because a few hundred metres of
    positional jitter across a 9 km step is several degrees of angle.  Holding

    and shatters oblique ridges -- measured, a straight 1300 km boundary came
    out as a 220 km fragment.  ``step_jitter_deg`` is the angle below which

    Masking and gaps in the evidence cut one physical boundary into several
    polylines, and nothing in the previous implementation put them back
    together, so a single front reached the map as fragments.

    The orientation caveat is the whole difficulty.  ``link_ridge_points``
    grows bidirectionally from a seed, so which end of a fragment is its
    "start" is an accident of where the seed happened to fall.  A first
    version only tested tail-to-head and therefore could not see half the
    joins that exist; measured on the real 850 hPa field, the engine produced
    a median of 34 fragments per hour whose longest was 195 km, every one of
    them then discarded by the 300 km minimum, and the whole run fell back to
    the old detector in 66 hours out of 73.  All four end pairings are tried
    here, reversing whichever fragment needs it.

    Reaching more joins also means reaching wrong ones, so geometry alone is
    not enough to authorise one: ``bridge_ok`` is asked whether the ground a
    bridge crosses actually carries frontal evidence.  Without it the axis of
    a straight analytic front began annexing the short off-axis fragments on
    its flanks and its curvature went from 2,4 to 9,0 degrees per 20 km.  Two
    pieces of one front have a front between them; a piece of one front and a
    piece of another do not.

    The end tests are local, and local tests can be passed by a join that is
    wrong globally: a fragment lying *beside* the main axis rather than beyond
    it has compatible tangents and a short, well-aligned bridge, and welding
    it on produces a dog-leg.  Measured on an oblique analytic front, that is
    exactly what happened -- 895 km at 3,2 degrees per 20 km became 1234 km at
    9,2.  So every join is finally judged on the thing actually wanted: the
    merged line must still come out under
    ``max_merged_turn_deg_per_20km``, the figure this project's own
    documentation sets for a publishable geometry.
